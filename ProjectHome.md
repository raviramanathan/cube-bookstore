The Cube is a book catalogue website written for [TWUSA](http://www.twusa.ca/). The Cube website is used as a key tool for the University's student-run used bookstore, which is naturally also called "The Cube".

"Sellers" may list their books online for sell. They do so by physically submitting their book to the store, at which point the staff enter the book into the website. When the book has been sold, the "seller" is notified.

"Buyers" may query for books and place holds on books they wish to purchase. They may then physically go to the store to purchase the book.

The Cube website does not do any ecommerce.
